## 🚀 What does Plinto do?

Plinto aims to replace the traditional spreadsheets many households rely on to track income, expenses, and pending payments. Instead of maintaining fragmented and manual records, the project explores a more structured, flexible, and modern way to organize household finances.

### Key Features

> **Note:** These represent the intended direction of the project rather than a finalized feature set.

- 📊 **Financial Tracking** - Track income, expenses, and pending payments
- 📈 **Better Understanding** - Gain insights into your financial situation
- 💡 **Informed Decisions** - Build healthier financial habits
- 🎯 **Long-term Planning** - Improve how families relate to and plan their finances

Beyond basic financial tracking, Plinto is designed as a supportive tool that helps people better understand their financial situation, build healthier habits, and make more informed decisions. The long-term vision seeks to assist families in improving how they relate to and plan their finances.

## 🚧 Getting Started

> ⚠️ **Early Development Stage**
> 
> Plinto is still in its early days, so there is currently no setup or onboarding process available. At this stage, the project is focused on defining its direction, ideas, and foundations—before any code is ready to run without complaints.

This section will be updated as soon as Plinto becomes something you can actually install, configure, and use without guessing. Until then, consider this documentation a preview of what's coming, rather than a set of instructions you can follow today.

---

## 🧭 Specs (Spec Kit)

Plinto includes **Spec Kit** to support a cleaner, more responsible use of AI agents (repeatable prompts, structured specs, and checklists) while keeping project decisions transparent.

The upstream Spec Kit project is maintained here: https://github.com/github/spec-kit

Using AI agents (or any Spec Kit automation) is **optional**—contributors can participate normally via issues and PRs without running agent workflows. If you prefer, just edit the Markdown docs in `docs/` and ignore `.codex/` and `.specify/`.

## 🤝 Contributing
